# Real-Time Search and Tab Filtration Application

This project is a web application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS that demonstrates real-time search and tab filtration functionalities. The application is styled to be responsive and modern, based on a Figma design.

- **Real-Time Search**: The search bar fetches and displays search results in real-time as the user types.
- **Tab Filtration**: Tabs filter the displayed content based on the selected category.
